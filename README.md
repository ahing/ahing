### Hi there üëã

**My name is Alec Hing** and I am a data scientist with a background in quality assurance within the tech industry and a recent graduate of the Flatiron School. I have 6+ years of experiece as a quality assurance analyst working for companies like Saks Fifth Avenue and Fox Corporation. I graduated with a bachelors in computer engineering at Stevens Institute of Techonology in 2018. I love staying up to date with the latest trends in technology, especially all things Apple. My curiosity lead me into the data science field because all these latest advances had me wondering, _"just how are they doing that?"_  I have gained a lot of experience through my almost decade of internships and my current full time job. I have seen how tech/digital team gets their work done and how they tackle new problems.

I became a data scientist because I am ready to take my experience in the technology field and my curiosity for the latest advances and begin solving meaningful problems in the world. I really want to see how all the bigeest companies are setting the trends we all follow, but most importantly help the world overall.

## What I'm up to:
- I am currently improving my skills in SQL
- Growing in my skills with Tableau
- ü§ù Opening my network for collaboration on machine learnning projects
- üìñ Keeping up with the most interesting blogs involving data science
- üóΩ NJ/NY based
- ü•Ö Goal: Continue my 2022 goal of travelling more outside the country!
